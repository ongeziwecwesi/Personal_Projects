Welcome to my personal projects repository! This collection includes projects I've worked on both as part of my coursework and in my spare time. Each project showcases my progress and understanding in programming, as well as practical applications for solving real-world problems.

Projects
1. Livestock Production Estimation Application
Description: This application estimates livestock production over various time periods (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, 5 years) based on several biological and operational factors. It includes a user registration system and produces predictions on the herdâ€™s future composition.
Technologies Used: Java, OOP principles
Features:
Livestock Project Class: Holds data on each member's registration information, including membership number, name, surname, date of birth, gender, location, and initial livestock count.
Estimation Method: Predicts livestock production based on factors like cow heat cycles, fertility rates, service rates, and specific birth statistics (gestation periods, puberty ages, etc.).
PredictProduction Class: Registers new members and calculates livestock production projections both per member and across the entire project. Provides detailed summaries by member and across the project, including breakdowns by bull and heifer populations.
2. Miles-Per-Gallon (MPG) Calculator
Description: A utility application for South African drivers to calculate their car's fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter, helping estimate fuel costs.
Technologies Used: Java, basic GUI design
Features:
Input Fields: Accepts kilometers driven and liters of fuel used.
Calculation: Outputs the calculated kilometers per liter to help drivers monitor and estimate fuel consumption.
3. Loan Comparison Tool with Interest Rate Variations
Description: A loan comparison application that calculates and displays monthly and total loan payments at various interest rates (from 5% to 8%, in 0.25% increments). Useful for evaluating loan costs over different time periods and rates.
Technologies Used: Java
Features:
Interest Rate Calculation: Computes monthly and total payments based on user-provided loan amount and period.
Incremental Rate Display: Provides loan comparisons across a range of interest rates to aid decision-making.
4. Java GUI Calculator (Basic and Scientific)
Description: A dual-function calculator application with options for both basic and scientific calculations.
Technologies Used: Java, Java Swing (GUI)
Features:
Basic Calculator: Provides simple arithmetic functions.
Scientific Calculator: Offers additional functions for advanced calculations.
Toggle Buttons: Switch between basic and scientific modes using radio buttons.
