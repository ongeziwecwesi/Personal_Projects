This Repository contains project my personal projects, it could be projects that i am given as assessments at school or projects that i program during my spare time.

1. CREATING AN APPLICATION FOR ESTIMATING LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION
(a) Create a class named LivestockProject with fields that hold a membership number, the 
name of the member, surname, date of birth, gender, location and initial number of livestock 
(cattle) turned in. Include a constructor that initializes each field to appropriate default 
values. Also include methods to set and get each of the fields.
(b) Create a livestock production estimation method(s) that will calculate and predict livestock 
production over a certain period of time (1 year, 2 years, 5 years, etc.), considering the 
following factors:
• The percentage of cows in heat in a 21-day period = 90%
• The percentage of the heats that are fertile = 90%
• The percentage of the cows that are serviced by the bull = 95%
• The 2 bulls per 100 cows ratio for a period of 5 years
• The percentage of calves born in the herd will be bull = 30%
• The gestation length of a bull valves = 287 days
• The gestation length of a heifer valves = 279 days
• The number of days a cow should undergo involution = 50 days
• The number of births a cow can give in its lifetime = 8 
• The age that a heifer requires to reach puberty and be bred = 14 months 
(c) Create a class named PredictProduction whose main() method instantiate an object of the 
class LivestockProject. Within the method, prompt a user for registration, indicating the 
name, surname, date of birth, gender, location and initial number of livestock (cattle) to turn 
in. When a certain number of members have been successfully registered, your application 
must print the following:
• The Database of registered members on the application
• Estimated livestock production per member over a certain period of time
• Estimated livestock production for the entire project over a certain period of time
• Estimated livestock production of bulls and heifers per member over a certain 
period of time
• Estimated livestock production of bulls and heifers for the entire project over a 
certain period of time


CREATING A Miles-Per-Gallon Calculator App
1.South African drivers often want to know the kilometres per litre their cars get so they can
estimate fuel costs. Develop an app that allows the user to input the number of kilometres driven
and the number of litres used and calculates and displays the corresponding kilometres per litre.
2. COMPARE LOANS WITH VARIOUS INTEREST RATES
Write a program that allows the user to enter the loan amount and loan period in number of years 
and displays the monthly and total payments for each interest rate starting from 5% to 8%, with 
an increment of ¼. 
Resources: Formula to compute monthly payment: Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, 
numberOfYears * 12)

1. Create a Java GUI project that has two RadoiButtons when you click the Basic Calculator radio button it should show the basic calculator and vice versa with Scientific Calculator
